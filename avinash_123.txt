According to me you should first explain the need for Git stash. 
Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for sometime to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is Git stash.
Now explain what is Git stash. 
Stashing takes your working directory that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.
